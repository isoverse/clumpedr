\title{Plot as a side-effect of a pipe}
\usage{
pipe_plot(.data, plotfun, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Tibble in the pipe.}

\item{plotfun}{Function to use for plotting.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to the plotting function.}
}
\description{
This function takes a tibble, applies a plotting function with additional
arguments, makes sure to print it, and then returns the original
\link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble} unaffected.
}
\details{
This is equivalent to running the \link[magrittr:\%T>\%]{magrittr::\%T>\%} operator with
curly braces and a print command, but this is much cleaner.
